## 🎯 Game Description
**Code Card Challenge** is a browser-based interactive game that blends the fun of **Three-Card Monte** with hands-on coding quizzes in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and DOM events.

- Each stage includes **two rounds**:  
  1. **Monte Card Shuffle:** Pick the right card after a shuffle. Correct guess scores points.
  2. **Coding Quiz:** Answer one multiple-choice coding question. Correct answers earn more points.
- After two consecutive Monte wins, card shuffle speed increases for added challenge!
- Play through **5 stages** to see if you can reach at least **12 out of 20 points** and win.

***

## 🚀 How to Play

1. Choose a quiz topic: **HTML**, **CSS**, or **JavaScript**.
2. Watch the custom “Evil Tower” themed cards shuffle, then pick one.
3. Answer the coding quiz for that stage.
4. Earn points for correct answers, with bonus difficulty if you keep winning in the Monte round!
5. Reach 12+ points by stage 5 to win.
